# hi

## i do a thing
### it’s called game development

it’s lowk pretty fun

i mostly work with:
- python
- roblox / lua
- gml
- C (sometimes because i hate it)

if something is annoying to use, i try to fix it

i also refuse to use HTML because its not a real language and i refuse to listen to anyone who does use it :3

i also play dayZ if you wanted to know
