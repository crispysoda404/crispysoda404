# hi

## i do a thing
### it’s called game development

it’s lowk pretty fun

i mostly work with:
- python
- roblox / lua
- modulescripts that make stuff not hard as hell to code
- gml
- C (sometimes because i hate it)

i like making tools more than pretending i’m a genius  
if something is annoying to use, i try to fix it

i also refuse to use HTML because its not a real language and i refuse to listen to anyone who does use it :3
